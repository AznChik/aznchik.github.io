This is what you're currently looking at. To the right of "App Components", you'll find the "+/-" button which'll toggle all sections.
In other words, all collapsed sections will become expanded & all expanded will collapse. I know there's a lot of information here, so
I hope the accordian interaction helps with usability and visual attraction.
