<h1>Welcome to My Code Portfolio!</h1>

<p>Everything on this site was coded from the ground up to hopefully display an accurate representation of my abilities.</p>

<p>I enjoy exploring the endless possibilites of creating visually appealing (gradients, animations, etc.) and interactive (hover, click, etc.) sites.</p>

<p>One thing to note in particular is that I tried to keep this compatible for most screens. I've accounted for widths between 320px - 1366px.</p>

<p>If you're curious about the source code, you can visit
<a href="https://github.com/AznChik/aznchik.github.io" target="_blank">my github repository</a>
to gain an understanding of my coding practices / organization.</p>

<p>Now, with all that out of the way, feel free to venture through my sample work & learn <a routerLink="/about-me">about me</a>!</p>
