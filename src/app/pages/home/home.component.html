    <h1>Welcome to My Code Portfolio!</h1>

    <p>
        Everything on this site was coded from the ground up to showcase my abilities.
        <br><br>I enjoy exploring the endless possibilites of creating visually appealing (gradients, animations, etc.) and interactive (hover, click, etc.) sites.
        <br><br>One thing to note in particular is that I tried to keep this compatible for most screens. I've accounted for widths between 320px - 1366px.

        <br><br>If you're curious about the source code, you can visit my
        <a href="https://github.com/AznChik/aznchik.github.io" target="_blank">github repository</a>
        to gain an understanding of my coding practices / organization.

        <br><br>Now, with all that out of the way, feel free to venture through my
        <button (click)="toggleSamples('open')">sample work</button> & learn <a routerLink="/about-me">about me</a>!

    <h1>Sample Work</h1>
    <button title='Exit sample work' (click)="toggleSamples('close')">X</button>
