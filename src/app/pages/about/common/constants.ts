    public static computer: string =
        "Computers have played a large role in my life and still do. I grew up on CD games (my favorites being Nancy Drew), transitioned to online games (addictingGames, coolMathGames, etc.), experienced YouTube's evolution, and joined the FaceBook craze in 8th grade (which I rarely use anymore). All the wonderous entertainment and info computers have offered inspired my career path as a way to give back.";
    public static origami: string =
        "I love crafts and paper has always been my preferred medium. It fascinates me how a flat 2D sheet can become a 3D masterpiece! Fun fact: I used to place origami roses randomly around my high school for fun. Never saw anyone's reaction to finding one though.";
    public static math: string =
        "Thank you CyberChase for hooking me on math since the age of 5. I like that it never contradicts itself and everything is logical. Growing up, I was always the go to person for math help and upon entering high school, I began tutoring. My favorite on-campus job in college was working at the Math Learning Center, helping with various math courses. Seeing students grasp a concept for the first time is the best feeling.";
    public static stitch: string =
        "'I'm cute & I'm fluffy!' Who can't love this little furball? There are so many fantastic Disney movies (admittedly, not all are winners though). I honestly don't have a favorite, but since I can do a Stitch impression, this one holds a special placement.";
    public static drawing: string =
        "I enjoy the challenge of looking at pictures and seeing how accurately I can replicate (tracing is a no-no). Since high school, I've been known to give drawings of people's favorite characters as surprise gifts.";
    public static tv: string =
        "2000 - 2010 was the golden decade of Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, & Cartoon Network in my opinion. Most of those shows had deep and/or intense story lines that were still kid friendly (Avatar: the Last Airbender, Teen Titans, etc.). Almost every show had a subliminal moral in each episode. These shows influenced much of my personality based off which characters I liked or not (YES - Jade Chan, Maddie Fitzpatrick, & Alex Russo; NO - Mertle Edmonds, Goo Foster, & Dijonay Jones).";
    public static physicalGames: string =
        "Settlers of Catan? Carcassone? I'm game! Every game has some factor of luck (die rolls, drawing cards, dealt hands), but it's games that don't solely rely on luck that I thoroughly enjoy. Recommendation: Red Dragon Inn & Games by Unstable Games.";
    public static virtualGames: string =
        "Technically, computer games were my first virtual games, but my world changed one Christmas morning when I was 7 and unwrapped a GameBoy Advance with Shrek 2 game (favorite game was Kim Possible 3: Team Possible). A year later, I upgraded to a DS (and many iterations a DS's as the years went on). I have fond memories of NintenDogs & Cooking Mama, but my 2 favorite series are: Professor Layton & Legend of Zelda. I was gifted a Wii in 4th grade (Guitar Hero was my favorite) and a switch in college (favorite being Indivisible). It's come full circle, as I now play on PC through Steam. I love how video games are basically interactive movies!";
    public static music: string =
        "Music has been a constant in my life. I enjoy a wide range of musicals from classics like Grease and West Side Story to ones I grew up with like Cheetah Girls & High School Musical (not to mention almost every Disney movie). For as long as I can remember, I've always enjoyed singing. On top of vocals, I dabble in piano & ukulele.";
    public static karate: string =
        "While I can definitely be a couch potato (mmm... potatoes...), I do have active interests as well. Biking, ice skating, rollar blading, and swimming are always a fun time. I went through quite a few classes growing up to see what would stick, and karate came out on top. I enjoyed memorizing katas and practicing moves with precise forms to enhance power. Unfortuneately, my lessons ceased in high school due to juggling too much and I haven't gone back. I ended with purple belt (2 colors away from black), but at least I reached at my favorite color. Eventlually, I would like to go back to it in the near future.";
